    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit or object. The object's internal workings are hidden from the outside world, and the object can only be accessed through a well-defined interface. This improves code maintainability, reusability, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes. The existing class is called the parent or superclass, and the new class is called the child or subclass. Inheritance allows for code reuse, promotes consistency, and makes it easier to modify existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading, which allows a method to have multiple definitions with different parameter lists, or method overriding, which allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of focusing on the essential features of an object or a problem and ignoring the details that are not relevant to the current context. Abstraction allows for simplification of complex systems, reduces code duplication, and promotes modularity. Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for other classes to follow"
